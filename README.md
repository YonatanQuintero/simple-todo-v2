Exercise 2: Enhanced Todo App with Context, Reducers, and Local Storage

Overview:

Enhance the basic todo list application by introducing context for theme management, reducers for global state management, and local storage for persistent data storage. This exercise will demonstrate how to combine these techniques to create a more sophisticated and feature-rich application.

Objectives:

Implement a ThemeContext to manage the application's light and dark themes.

Utilize reducers to handle state updates for adding, removing, and toggling the completion status of todo items.

Employ local storage to persist todo data across page refreshes and application restarts.

Implementation:

Create a ThemeContext using React.createContext() and define a ThemeProvider component to expose the theme context.

Implement reducers using useReducer() to manage the todo list state.

Use the ThemeContext and reducers within components to handle theme changes and todo item updates.

Utilize local storage to store and retrieve todo data using localStorage API.

Benefits:

Improved code organization and separation of concerns using context, reducers, and local storage.

Enhanced user experience with a customizable theme.

Persistent data storage for maintaining todo lists across sessions.

Insights:

Context provides a centralized approach to managing global state, such as the application theme.

Reducers facilitate efficient state updates and ensure predictable state changes.

Local storage enables persistent data storage, preserving user data even after application reloads.

Demonstration:

Develop the enhanced todo application, incorporating context for theme management, reducers for global state management, and local storage for persistent data storage. Showcase the ability to change themes, add, remove, and toggle todo items, and maintain the todo list across page refreshes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
